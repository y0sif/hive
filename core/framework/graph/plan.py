"""
Plan Data Structures for Flexible Execution.

Plans are created externally (by Claude Code or another LLM agent) and
executed internally by the FlexibleGraphExecutor with Worker-Judge loop.

The Plan is the contract between the external planner and the executor:
- Planner creates a Plan with PlanSteps
- Executor runs steps and judges results
- If replanning needed, returns feedback to external planner
