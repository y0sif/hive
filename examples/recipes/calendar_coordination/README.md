# Recipe: Travel & Calendar Coordination

Protecting your "Deep Work" time from getting fragmented by random 15-minute meetings.

## Why

Your calendar is a battlefield. Everyone wants a slice of your time, and without protection, your days become a patchwork of 30-minute meetings with no room for actual work. This agent defends your schedule — booking travel, consolidating meetings, and protecting the focus time you need to think.

## What

- Block and protect "Deep Work" time slots
- Batch similar meetings together to reduce context switching
- Book travel (flights, hotels, ground transport)
- Handle meeting requests and rescheduling
- Prep briefing docs before important meetings
