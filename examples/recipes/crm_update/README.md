# Recipe: CRM Update

Ensuring every lead has a follow-up date and a status update.

## Why

A messy CRM is a leaky pipeline. Leads without follow-up dates get forgotten. Deals without status updates go stale. This agent keeps your CRM clean and actionable — so when you open it, you see exactly what needs your attention today.

## What

- Audit leads missing follow-up dates or status updates
- Flag stale deals that haven't been touched in X days
- Merge duplicate contacts and companies
- Enrich records with missing data (email, phone, company info)
- Generate daily "pipeline hygiene" reports
