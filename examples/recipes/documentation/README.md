# Recipe: Documentation

Turning your messy processes into clean Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

## Why

Knowledge trapped in your head is a liability. When you're the only one who knows how things work, you become the bottleneck for everything. This agent captures your processes, cleans them up, and turns them into documentation anyone can follow — including your future self.

## What

- Watch you perform processes and document the steps
- Convert rough notes and recordings into structured SOPs
- Maintain and update existing documentation
- Identify undocumented processes that need capture
- Create quick-reference guides and checklists

## Integrations

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Notion / Confluence / GitBook | Documentation hosting |
| Loom / Screen recording | Process capture |
| Otter.ai / Whisper | Meeting and explanation transcription |
| Slack | Documentation requests and updates |
| GitHub | Technical documentation and READMEs |
| Google Docs | Collaborative editing |

## Escalation Path

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Process has conflicting documentation | Flag discrepancy for clarification |
| SOP referenced but outdated >6 months | Queue for your review and update |
| Someone asks question not covered by docs | Note the gap, draft new section for approval |
| Critical process has no documentation | Alert as priority documentation needed |
| Documentation contradicts current practice | Flag for reconciliation — update docs or process? |
| External compliance requirement needs docs | Escalate with deadline and requirements |
