# Recipe: Inbox Management

Clearing out the spam and highlighting the three emails that actually need your brain.

## Why

Email is where productivity goes to die. The average CEO gets 120+ emails per day, but only a handful actually matter. This agent acts as your email bouncer — filtering the noise so you can focus on the messages that move the needle.

## What

- Filter and archive spam, newsletters, and low-priority messages
- Categorize emails by urgency and type (action needed, FYI, waiting on)
- Summarize long email threads into key points
- Draft responses for routine inquiries
- Surface the 3-5 emails that truly need your attention

## Integrations

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Gmail API / Microsoft Graph | Email access and management |
| Google Calendar | Context for scheduling-related emails |
| Slack | Daily inbox briefing and urgent alerts |
| Notion | Email summary archive for reference |
| Your CRM | Cross-reference with known contacts and deals |

## Escalation Path

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Email from VIP contact (investor, key client, partner) | Surface immediately, never auto-respond |
| Legal or compliance language detected | Flag for your review — do not respond |
| Angry or escalation tone detected | Alert with suggested de-escalation response |
| Email requires decision with financial impact | Queue for your review with context |
| Unrecognized sender with urgent request | Flag as potential phishing or verify before acting |
