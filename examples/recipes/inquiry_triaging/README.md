# Recipe: Inquiry Triaging

Sorting the "tire kickers" from the "hot leads."

## Why

Not all leads are created equal. For every serious buyer, there are ten people who'll never purchase. Your time should go to the prospects most likely to close — this agent scores and routes inquiries so you only see the ones worth your attention.

## What

- Analyze incoming inquiries for buying signals
- Score leads based on company size, budget mentions, urgency, and fit
- Route hot leads to your calendar immediately
- Nurture warm leads with automated sequences
- Politely deflect poor-fit inquiries

| Lead mentions competitor by name | Flag for competitive positioning response |
| Urgent language detected ("need this week", "ASAP") | Fast-track to your calendar |
| Lead asks question outside playbook | Queue for your personal response |
| High-value lead goes cold (no response in 48h) | Alert with re-engagement suggestions |
