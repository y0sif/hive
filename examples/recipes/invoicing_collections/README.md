# Recipe: Invoicing & Collections

Sending out bills and—more importantly—politely chasing down the people who haven't paid them.

## Why

Cash flow is oxygen. But chasing invoices is awkward and time-consuming. This agent handles the uncomfortable job of asking for money — sending invoices on time, following up persistently but politely, and only escalating when the situation requires your personal touch.

## What

- Generate and send invoices on schedule
- Track payment status across all outstanding invoices
- Send automated payment reminders (friendly → firm → final)
- Reconcile payments with bank transactions
- Report on AR aging and cash flow projections
