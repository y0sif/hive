# Recipe: Newsletter Production

Taking your raw ideas or voice memos and turning them into a polished weekly email.

## Why

Your audience wants to hear from you, not your ghostwriter. But you don't have 4 hours to craft the perfect newsletter. This agent captures your voice from quick inputs — voice memos, bullet points, Slack messages — and transforms them into publish-ready emails that sound like you.

## What

- Ingest raw content (voice memos, notes, bullet points)
- Draft newsletter in your voice and style
- Format with headers, links, and CTAs
- Schedule for optimal send time
- Track open rates and click-through for future optimization
