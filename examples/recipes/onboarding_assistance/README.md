# Recipe: Onboarding Assistance

Helping new clients set up their accounts or sending out "Welcome" kits.

## Why

First impressions stick. A smooth onboarding experience sets the tone for the entire customer relationship — but walking each new client through the same steps is a time sink. This agent delivers a white-glove experience at scale, making every customer feel personally welcomed.

## What

- Send personalized welcome emails and kits
- Guide clients through account setup step-by-step
- Answer common "getting started" questions
- Track onboarding completion and milestone progress
- Follow up on incomplete setups

## Integrations

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Intercom / Customer.io | Onboarding email sequences |
| Notion / Loom | Tutorial content and documentation |
| Calendly | Onboarding call scheduling |
| Slack / Email | Progress updates and escalations |

## Escalation Path

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Client stuck on setup >48 hours | Alert with where they're stuck and offer to schedule call |
| Technical blocker during setup | Route to support with context already gathered |
| High-value client starts onboarding | Notify so you can send personal welcome |
| Client expresses frustration | Immediate flag for human intervention |
| Onboarding incomplete after 7 days | Escalate with churn risk assessment |
