# Recipe: Social Media Management

Scheduling posts, replying to comments, and monitoring trends.

## Why

Consistency kills on social media — but it also kills your time. One "quick post" turns into an hour of tweaking copy, finding hashtags, and responding to comments. This agent maintains your social presence so you stay visible without staying glued to your phone.

## What

- Schedule posts across platforms (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)
- Reply to comments and DMs with on-brand responses
- Monitor trending topics and hashtags in your niche
- Track engagement metrics and surface what's working

## Integrations

| Platform | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Buffer / Hootsuite / Later | Post scheduling and publishing |
| Twitter/X API | Direct posting and engagement |
| LinkedIn API | Professional network management |
| Meta Graph API | Facebook/Instagram management |
| Slack | Notifications and escalations |

## Escalation Path

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Post goes viral (>10x normal engagement) | Alert with engagement stats and suggested follow-up content |
| Negative viral moment | Immediate alert — do NOT auto-respond, queue for human review |
| Influencer or press mentions you | Flag for personal response opportunity |
| Controversial topic trending in your space | Alert before posting scheduled content that might be tone-deaf |
| DM from verified account or known lead | Route directly to you |
